5thEditionCharacterSheet
========================

This is an attempt to create a "front-end only" character sheet for d&d 5e that reads characters that are specified via json.

This is deployed every now and then to https://kjwise.github.io/charsheet.html

Test with data: https://kjwise.github.io/charsheet.html?charURL=fireaxe.js
