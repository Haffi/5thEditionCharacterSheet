5thEditionCharacterSheet
========================

This is a json(p) driven character sheet for D&D 5e.
It uses twitter bootstrap and is decently responsive, even for print!

You can host your character sheet and your character data anywhere on the public internet.
The character data can be kept on a different servers from the one that hosts the html, css & script.js. 
It's all just happening in the front-end so no webserver is required. 

The sheet supports multiple classes and automatically computes ability modifiers, skill modifiers and character proficiency level.
Just look at the example character files to get started with your own.
