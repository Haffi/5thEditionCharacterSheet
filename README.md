5thEditionCharacterSheet
========================

This is a json(p) driven caracter sheet for D&D 5e based on the form fillable pdf versions.
You can host your character sheet and your character data anywhere on the public internet.
The character data can be kept on a different servers from the one that hosts the html, css & script.js. 
It's all just happening in the front-end so yeah, no special hosting required. 

The sheet supports multiple classes and automatically computes ability modifiers, skill modifiers and character proficiency level. Just look at the example character files to get started with your own.

The sheet is somewhat responsive, but has not been developed mobile first.
Better support for mobile browsers is forthcoming.
